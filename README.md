**Completion Rate Analysis:**

Analyzed completion rates by slot vs. day of the week, identifying patterns and optimizing delivery schedules. Calculated completion rates at drop area and number of products ordered level, enhancing operational efficiency.

**Customer Level Analysis:**

Identified completion rates by customer acquisition source, guiding marketing and customer acquisition strategies. Calculated Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and aggregated LTV at source and acquisition month levels, informing customer retention efforts. Analyzed average revenue per order by customer acquisition source and month, guiding sales and promotional strategies.

**Delivery Analysis:**
